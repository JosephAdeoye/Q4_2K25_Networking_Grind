# LAN, WAN, and MAN

Understanding the scope of different network types is fundamental in networking.  
Below are the key distinctions between **LAN**, **WAN**, and **MAN**.

---

## üè† Local Area Network (LAN)
A **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects computers and other devices within a **small geographical area**,  
such as a single building, office, or campus.  

- High-speed and low latency  
- Privately owned and managed  
- Common technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi  

üìò **Example:**  
A network connecting PCs and printers within an office building.

---

## üåç Wide Area Network (WAN)
A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** spans a **large geographical area**, connecting multiple LANs.  
It often uses **service provider infrastructure** to connect sites across cities, countries, or continents.  

- Uses public or leased communication lines (e.g., MPLS, Internet, VPN)  
- Requires routing and security control  

üìò **Example:**  
A multinational company linking branch offices across different regions through leased lines or VPN tunnels.

---

## üèôÔ∏è Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** covers a **geographic area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN** ‚Äî  
typically a **city or metropolitan region**.  

- Used to connect multiple LANs within the same city  
- Often managed by ISPs or municipal entities  
- Offers high-speed connectivity between local sites  

üìò **Example:**  
A university with multiple campuses across a city connected via fiber optic backbone.

### üß© Summary Table

| Network Type | Typical Area Covered      | Ownership        | Example Use Case                   |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **LAN**       | Building or campus        | Private          | Office or school network           |
| **MAN**       | City or metropolitan area | Private/Public   | Inter-campus connection            |
| **WAN**       | Country or global region  | Public/Carrier   | Corporate network over the Internet |

üí° **Tip:** LANs form the foundation of all networking; WANs connect LANs, and MANs act as the bridge between the two.

VPN - Virtual Private Networks
- A VPN provides a virtual tunnel between private networks across a shared public network, such as the Internet
- Traffic tunnel over the tunnel is encrypted and only readable by the authorised user on both sides
- Users can share data over the tunnel as if they were connected with a dedicated private link
- VPNs allow an organisation to use the same physical links for connectivity to the internet and between offices
- Because they use shared infrastructure, VPN connections are  typically less expensive than dedicated physical links

Types of VPNs: Site-to-Site VPN and Remote Access VPN
# Site-to-Site VPN
- Site-to-Site VPN connections are terminated on a router or firewall in each office
- Software does not need to be installed on user desktops
- IPsec is typically used for encryption

# Remote Access VPN
- Remote Access VPN connections are between a router or firewall in the office and VPN software installed on an individual user's device
- The user can access the VPN from anywhere with Internet connectivity
- They usually use SSL (sometimes IPsec) for encryption

# Site-to-Site IPsec VPN Configuration Options
- IPsec Tunnel: open standard IPsec tunnel, does not support multicast
- GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) over IPsec tunnel: adds support for multicast
- IPsec VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface): Cisco proprietary simplified configuration, supports multicast
- DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN): Cisco proprietary. Scalable, simple hub and spoke style configuration enables direct full mesh connectivity between all offices
- FlexVPN: Cisco proprietary. Very similar to DMVPN, a newer technology
- GETVPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN): Cisco proprietary. Scalable centralised policy for VPN over non-public infrastructure, eg MPLS.

WAN Connectivity Options
# Primary WAN Connectivity Options
- Leased Line
- MPLS -- Multi-Protocol Label Switching --
- Satellite

- The service provider will typically provide an SLA (Service Level Agreement) with guarantees for uptime and traffic delay and loss on the link

# Optical Fiber
- Optical fiber is more suitable for long distances than copper wire
- It is commonly used for service provider backhaul connections, but can also be offered to their customers
- FTTx services:
  - Fiber to the Home
  - Fiber to the Premises
  - Fiber to the Building
  - Fiber to the Neighborhood

# DWDM Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
- DWDM combines ('multiplexes') multiple optical signals into one optical signal transmitted over a single fiber strand
- Each signal is assigned a different wavelength
- DWDM allows more capacity to be added to existing infrastructure without expensive upgrades
- DWDM is used in all modern long-haul optical connections

#  WAN Backup and Small Office Solutions
- Less expensive options, often aimed at home user internet access, can be used as Internet VPN WAN backup options in corporate environments
- There will typically be no corporate-level SLA with these services
- These can be used as the primary WAN connection method to the corporate network from smaller offices and for home users
  - DSL Digital Subscriber Line
  - Cable
  - Wireless eg 4G

# Leased Lines
- A leased line is a dedicated physical connection between two locations
- It has fixed, reserved bandwidth, which is not shared with anyone else
- The same bandwidth is available in both directions
- The company may own the cable infrastructure, but more commonly it is leased from a service provider for a monthly fee, hence the name 'leased line' 

- The first location is typically a corporate office.
- The second location is typically:
  - Another corporate office, providing point-to-point connectivity between the two offices
  - A data centre that's connected to the company's existing Wide Area Network, providing multipoint connectivity between offices
  - A data centre that's connected to the internet, providing Internet connectivity, and optionally corporate office connectivity over internet VPN

# Leased Lines Benefits and Drawbacks
- Leased lines have fixed, reserved bandwidth, which is not shared with anyone else.
- The service provider will typically provide an SLA (Service Level Agreement) with guarantees for uptime and traffic delay, and loss on the link
- Leased lines are typically more expensive than the other options
- There is usually a longer lead time for installation
- Copper or Fiber Ethernet connectivity options to the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) are becoming more common than serial leased lines.

# Satellite
- Satellite connections share the same characteristics as cabled leased lines 
- They are  typically expensive and low-bandwidth
- They may be the only option in hard-to-reach areas

# MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) VPN
- WAN connectivity can be provided over an MPLS infrastructure, usually operated by a service provider
- Traffic from multiple customers can travel over the provider's shared MPLS network, so this is a VPN service
- Different levels of SLA for uptime and traffic delay, and loss are often available at different price points
- Ethernet connections are typically used to connect to the customer router
- MPLS VPNs provide a full mesh topology by default

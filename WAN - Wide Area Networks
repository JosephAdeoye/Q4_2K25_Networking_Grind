# LAN, WAN, and MAN

Understanding the scope of different network types is fundamental in networking.  
Below are the key distinctions between **LAN**, **WAN**, and **MAN**.

---

## 🏠 Local Area Network (LAN)
A **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects computers and other devices within a **small geographical area**,  
such as a single building, office, or campus.  

- High-speed and low latency  
- Privately owned and managed  
- Common technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi  

📘 **Example:**  
A network connecting PCs and printers within an office building.

---

## 🌍 Wide Area Network (WAN)
A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** spans a **large geographical area**, connecting multiple LANs.  
It often uses **service provider infrastructure** to connect sites across cities, countries, or continents.  

- Uses public or leased communication lines (e.g., MPLS, Internet, VPN)  
- Requires routing and security control  

📘 **Example:**  
A multinational company linking branch offices across different regions through leased lines or VPN tunnels.

## 🏙️ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** covers a **geographic area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN** —  
typically a **city or metropolitan region**.  

- Used to connect multiple LANs within the same city  
- Often managed by ISPs or municipal entities  
- Offers high-speed connectivity between local sites  

📘 **Example:**  
A university with multiple campuses across a city connected via fiber optic backbone.

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Network Type | Typical Area Covered      | Ownership        | Example Use Case                   |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **LAN**       | Building or campus        | Private          | Office or school network           |
| **MAN**       | City or metropolitan area | Private/Public   | Inter-campus connection            |
| **WAN**       | Country or global region  | Public/Carrier   | Corporate network over the Internet |

💡 **Tip:** LANs form the foundation of all networking; WANs connect LANs, and MANs act as the bridge between the two.

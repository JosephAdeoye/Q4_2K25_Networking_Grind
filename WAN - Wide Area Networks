# LAN, WAN, and MAN

Understanding the scope of different network types is fundamental in networking.  
Below are the key distinctions between **LAN**, **WAN**, and **MAN**.

---

## 🏠 Local Area Network (LAN)
A **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects computers and other devices within a **small geographical area**,  
such as a single building, office, or campus.  

- High-speed and low latency  
- Privately owned and managed  
- Common technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi  

📘 **Example:**  
A network connecting PCs and printers within an office building.

---

## 🌍 Wide Area Network (WAN)
A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** spans a **large geographical area**, connecting multiple LANs.  
It often uses **service provider infrastructure** to connect sites across cities, countries, or continents.  

- Uses public or leased communication lines (e.g., MPLS, Internet, VPN)  
- Requires routing and security control  

📘 **Example:**  
A multinational company linking branch offices across different regions through leased lines or VPN tunnels.

---

## 🏙️ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** covers a **geographic area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN** —  
typically a **city or metropolitan region**.  

- Used to connect multiple LANs within the same city  
- Often managed by ISPs or municipal entities  
- Offers high-speed connectivity between local sites  

📘 **Example:**  
A university with multiple campuses across a city connected via fiber optic backbone.

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Network Type | Typical Area Covered      | Ownership        | Example Use Case                   |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **LAN**       | Building or campus        | Private          | Office or school network           |
| **MAN**       | City or metropolitan area | Private/Public   | Inter-campus connection            |
| **WAN**       | Country or global region  | Public/Carrier   | Corporate network over the Internet |

💡 **Tip:** LANs form the foundation of all networking; WANs connect LANs, and MANs act as the bridge between the two.

VPN - Virtual Private Networks
- A VPN provides a virtual tunnel between private networks across a shared public network, such as the Internet
- Traffic tunnel over the tunnel is encrypted and only readable by the authorised user on both sides
- Users can share data over the tunnel as if they were connected with a dedicated private link
- VPNs allow an organisation to use the same physical links for connectivity to the internet and between offices
- Because they use shared infrastructure, VPN connections are  typically less expensive than dedicated physical links

Types of VPNs: Site-to-Site VPN and Remote Access VPN
# Site-to-Site VPN
- Site-to-Site VPN connections are terminated on a router or firewall in each office
- Software does not need to be installed on user desktops
- IPsec is typically used for encryption

# Remote Access VPN
- Remote Access VPN connections are between a router or firewall in the office and VPN software installed on an individual user's device
- The user can access the VPN from anywhere with Internet connectivity
- They usually use SSL (sometimes IPsec) for encryption

# Site-to-Site IPsec VPN Configuration Options
- IPsec Tunnel: open standard IPsec tunnel, does not support multicast
- GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) over IPsec tunnel: adds support for multicast
- IPsec VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface): Cisco proprietary simplified configuration, supports multicast
- DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN): Cisco proprietary. Scalable, simple hub and spoke style configuration enables direct full mesh connectivity between all offices
- FlexVPN: Cisco proprietary. Very similar to DMVPN, a newer technology
- GETVPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN): Cisco proprietary. Scalable centralised policy for VPN over non-public infrastructure, eg MPLS.

Router Functions
  A router has two main functions:
    - Determining the best path to available networks
    - Forwarding traffic to those networks
    - The best available path or paths to a destination network are listed in a router's ROUTING TABLE and will be used for forwarding traffic
    - A routing table consists of directly connected networks and routes configured statically by the administrator or dynamically learned through a routing protocol
The command to view the routing table on a router is 'show ip route'

  Static Routes
    - If a router receives traffic for a network to which it is not directly attached, it needs to know how to get there to forward the traffic
    - An administrator can manually add a static route to the destination, or the router can learn it via a routing protocol

  Summary Routes
    - For static routing, summary routes lessen administrative overhead and memory usage on the routers
    - Summarisation doesn't have to be on classful boundaries
      - In classful networking (older method), networks were divided strictly into Class A (/8), Class B (/16), and Class C (/24) boundaries.
      - "Route summarisation does not have to be on classful boundaries" means that with classless routing (CIDR), you can summarise networks at any bit boundary, not just at the old classful limits.
          - Example:
              - Networks: 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.3.0/24
              - These can be summarised as 192.168.0.0/22, which is not a traditional Class C boundary, but still valid in classless routing.

              - IP address range 10.1.0.0 to 10.1.3.0 can be summarised to 10.1.0.0 255.255.252.0

      - LONGEST PREFIX MATCH 
        When there are overlapping routes, the longest prefix will be selected. 
        This simply means that the more specific route would be selected.

      - LOAD BALANCING
        When multiple equal-length routes are added for the same destination, the router would add them all to the routing table and load balance between them

      - DEFAULT ROUTE
        0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 - A default route is a catch-all for any traffic that doesn't match our specific routes

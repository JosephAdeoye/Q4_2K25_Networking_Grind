Routers learn routes by:
  - An administrator configuring IP addresses on its interfaces (Connected and Local routes)
  - An administrator configuring Static routes on that router
  - Receiving them via routing protocols from neighbouring routers

Route Precedence
  - A router's main job is to forward packets received towards their destination, based on the packet's destination IP address
  - It decides where to forward a packet based on the routes it has learned 
  - The best route for a packet decision is based on:
    1. Longest prefix (most specific)
    2. AD Administrative Distance
    3. Metric (cost)

  - If a router learns multiple routes for the same network and prefix, it must decide which is the best route
  - For example, these routes are for the same network and prefix:
    - 192.168.0.0/24 received via EIGRP from R2
    - 192.168.0.0/24 received via OSPF from R3
  - Only the best route for each learned network/prefix makes it into the routing table and is used to forward packets
  - Criteria for which is the best route to the same network/prefix:
    1. Administrative Distance (lower value is better.) If there is a tie:
    2. Metric (lower value is better)
  - If there are multiple best routes with the same ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE and METRIC, they will all enter the routing table, and the router will perform Equal Cost Load Balancing over them

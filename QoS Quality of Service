Traditional vs Converged Networks
- On old traditional networks, data, voice and video had their own separate network infrastructure and did not impact each other
- On modern networks, data, voice and video run over the same shared infrastructure
- This enables cost savings and advanced features for voice and video
- Data, voice and video are all fighting for the same shared bandwidth

Quality Requirements for Voice and Video
- Voice and traditional standard definition video packets must meet these recommended requirements to be an acceptable quality call:
  1. Latency (delay) < 150 ms
  2. Jitter (variation in delay) < 30 ms
  3. Loss < 1%
- These are one way requirements, meaning a packet sent from a phone in HQ has 150ms to reach the phone in the branch, and vice versa
- HD video has stricter requirements

Effects of Congestion
- Congestion causes delay to packets as they wait in the queue
- As the size of the queue changes it causes jitter
- There is a limit to the size of the queue. If a packet arrives when the queue is full the router will drop it
- Voice and video calls (and applications) will be unacceptable quality if they do not meet their delay, jitter and loss requirements

How to Mitigate Congestion
- Add more bandwidth (this costs money)
- Use Quality of Service techniques to give better service to the traffic which needs it

Effects of QoS Queuing
- QoS queing can reduce latency, jitter and loss for particular traffic
- The original driver for QoS was Voice over IP but it can also be used to give better service to data applications
- If you are giving one type of traffic better service on the same link you started with, the other traffic types must get worse service
- The point is to give each type of traffic the service it requires
- QoS queuing is not a magic bullet and is designed to mitigate temporary periods of congestion. If a link is permanently congested, the bandwidth should be increased.

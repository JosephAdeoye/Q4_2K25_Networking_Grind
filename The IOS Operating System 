The Cisco Nexus and MDS data center switch product lines run on NX-OS.
The IOS-XR operating system runs on the service provider NCS, CRS, ASR9000 and XR12000 series routers.
IOS-XE runs on the ASR1000 series service provider routers.
The command line interfaces for the other operating systems are nearly identical to IOS.

In-band management: Accessing and managing a device through the same network it serves (e.g., SSH, Telnet).
Out-of-band management: Accessing and managing a device through a dedicated channel/interface separate from the production network (e.g., console port, management port).
Key difference: In-band relies on the production network being up, while out-of-band works independently even if the network is down.

CISCO IOS CLI BASICS

1. User Modes

| Prompt Example         | Mode                          | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hostname>`            | **User EXEC mode**            | Limited access; basic monitoring commands only.                            |
| `hostname#`            | **Privileged EXEC mode**      | Access to all commands; entered with `enable`.                             |
| `hostname(config)#`    | **Global Configuration mode** | Used to configure system-wide settings; entered with `configure terminal`. |
| `hostname(config-if)#` | **Interface Configuration**   | Used to configure a specific interface (e.g., Ethernet, Serial).           |

2. Command Abbreviation

Cisco IOS allows you to type shortened commands if the abbreviation is unique.

Example:

en → enable

conf t → configure terminal

3. Context-Sensitive Help (?)

Use ? at any point to see available commands or options.

Examples:

sh? → shows all commands starting with "sh".

show ? → lists all options for the show command.

show ip ? → lists options for the show ip subcommands.

4. Editing & Navigation Shortcuts

Backspace → deletes the previous character.

Arrow Keys → move the cursor left/right (one character).

Ctrl + A → moves cursor to the beginning of the line.

Ctrl + E → moves cursor to the end of the line.

Ctrl + U → deletes the entire line.

Ctrl + W → deletes the word to the left of the cursor.

Tab → auto-completes a command (if unambiguous).

5. Useful IOS Tips

History Navigation:

Use the Up/Down arrows to scroll through previously entered commands.

Configure history size with:

terminal history size <number>

Command Recall: Use Ctrl + P (previous) and Ctrl + N (next) as alternatives to arrow keys.

Saving Configurations:

write memory or copy running-config startup-config → saves current running config to NVRAM.

Viewing Configurations:

show running-config → shows active configuration.

show startup-config → shows configuration stored in NVRAM.

Moving Between Interfaces (IOS)

Jump directly to another interface (no need to exit):
interface GigabitEthernet0/2

Return to global config from an interface:
exit

Switch to a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI):
interface vlan 10

Create/use a loopback:
interface loopback 0

Configure many at once:
interface range g0/1 - 4
interface range f0/1 , f0/3 - 5

Quickly see names/status while in config mode:
do show ip interface brief

## Command History  
- The **Up (↑)** and **Down (↓)** arrow keys cycle through previously entered commands at the same mode/level.  

  ## Showing Command Output  
- **Enter (↵)** → scrolls through `show` command output **one line at a time**.  
- **Spacebar** → scrolls through output **one page at a time**.  
- **Ctrl + C** → stops the command output and returns immediately to the command prompt.  
- **Ctrl + Z** → can also interrupt some processes and return to privileged EXEC mode.  

## Piped Command Examples  

The pipe (`|`) symbol filters command output to make it easier to read.  

- `show running-config interface FastEthernet0/0`  
  → Displays only the configuration for **FastEthernet0/0**.  

- `show running-config | begin FastEthernet0/0`  
  → Shows the config **starting from** the first line that matches `FastEthernet0/0`.  

- `show running-config | include FastEthernet0/0`  
  → Shows only lines that **contain** `FastEthernet0/0`.  

- `show running-config | exclude FastEthernet0/0`  
  → Shows all lines **except** those containing `FastEthernet0/0`.  

- `show running-config | section interface`  
  → Displays entire **sections** of the config that begin with the word `interface`.  

## Configuration Storage Locations  
- **Flash** → Stores the **IOS operating system image**.  
- **NVRAM** → Stores the **Startup Configuration** (persistent config loaded at boot).  
- **RAM** → Holds the **Running Configuration** (active config currently in use, loaded from startup config at boot).  

---

## Saving the Configuration  
- All commands take effect **immediately** but are **not saved** after a reboot unless written to NVRAM.  
- **Save running config to startup config (make persistent):**

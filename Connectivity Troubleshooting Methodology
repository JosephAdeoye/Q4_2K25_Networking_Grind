Connectivity Test Tools
  # PING 
  - The PING tool uses ICMP to test reachability between two endpoints on a network
  - The sender sends an ECHO Request, while the receiver, if reachable, sends an ECHO Reply
ICMP - INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL
  # TRACEROUTE 
  - Trace route is very similar to PING and is also used for checking connectivity
  - It traces the path that traffic is following in the network
  - The TRACEROUTE uses the TTL field to prevent routing loops.
  - TTL is Time to Live 
  - Every time a router processes a packet, it decrements the TTL field by one. 
  - The TTL field ensures that packets do not loop in the network forever

Dynamic Routing Protocols 
  - When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other.
  - Routers use this information to determine their own best path to the known destinations
  - When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other.
  - Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes. 
  - Summary routes lead to less memory usage in routers as their routing tables contain fewer routes.
  - They also lead to less CPU usage, as changes in the network only affect other routers in the same area

Dynamic Routing Protocols vs Static Routes
  - Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator-defined static routes.
  - Using purely static routes is only feasible in very small environments

Dynamic Routing Protocols Advantages
  - The routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter every route on every router,
  - If a subnet is added or removed, the routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables.
  - If the best path to a subnet goes down, routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available.
  - Using a combination of a dynamic routing protocol and static routes is very common in real-world environments.
  - In this case, the routing protocol will be used to carry the bulk of the network information.
  - Static routes can also be used on an as-needed basis. For example, for backup purposes or for a static route to the internet(which will typically be injected into the dynamic routing protocol and advertised to the rest of the routers). 

ROUTING PROTOCOLS TYPES
Routing protocols can be split into two main types:
    - Interior gateway protocols (IGPs)
    - Exterior gateway protocols (EGPs)
Interior gateway protocols are used for routing within an organisation
Exterior gateway protocols are used for routing between organisations over the Internet
The only EGP in use today is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Interior gateway protocols can be split into two main types:
    - Distance Vector routing protocols
    - Link State routing protocols

DISTANCE VECTOR ROUTING PROTOCOLS
    - In Distance Vector protocols, each router sends its directly connected neighbours a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks
    - Distance vector routing protocols do not advertise the entire network topology
    - A router only knows its directly connected neighbours and the lists of networks those neighbours have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbours
    - Distance Vector routing protocols are often called 'Routing by rumour'.

LINK STATE ROUTING PROTOCOLS
    - In Link State routing protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbours
    - This information is passed unchanged from one router to another
    - Every router learns the full picture of the network, including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to

## ROUTING PROTOCOLS

Routing protocols are categorised into **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)** and **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)**.

### Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)
Used **within a single Autonomous System (AS)**.

- **Distance Vector Protocols**
  - RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
  - EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) → often called "Advanced Distance Vector"

- **Link State Protocols**
  - OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
  - IS-IS (Intermediate System – Intermediate System)

### Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)
Used **between different Autonomous Systems (ASes)**.

- **Path Vector Protocols**
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

| **Updates**          | Periodic (broadcasts entire table) | Triggered, only when topology changes     | Updates based on AS-path changes |
| **Knowledge**        | Knows only next hop              | Has complete topology of the network      | Knows entire AS-path to destination |
| **Convergence**      | Slower (RIP), faster (EIGRP)     | Faster convergence                        | Slower (Internet scale) |
| **Scalability**      | Low (RIP limited to 15 hops)     | High (OSPF/IS-IS scale well in large AS)  | Very High (global Internet) |
| **Use Case**         | Small networks, legacy           | Large enterprise and ISP internal networks | Internet routing between ISPs |

INTERIOR GATEWAY PROTOCOLS
    - All of the IGPs do the same job, which is to advertise routes within an organisation and determine the best path or paths
    - An organisation will typically pick one of the IGPs
    - If an organisation has multiple IGPs in effect (for example, because of a merger or an acquisition), information can be redistributed between them. This should generally be avoided.

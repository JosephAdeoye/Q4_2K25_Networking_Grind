Dynamic Routing Protocols 
  - When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other.
  - Routers use this information to determine their own best path to the known destinations
  - When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other.
  - Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes. 
  - Summary routes lead to less memory usage in routers as their routing tables contain fewer routes.
  - They also lead to less CPU usage, as changes in the network only affect other routers in the same area

Dynamic Routing Protocols vs Static Routes
  - Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator-defined static routes.
  - Using purely static routes is only feasible in very small environments

Dynamic Routing Protocols Advantages
  - The routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter every route on every router,
  - If a subnet is added or removed, the routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables.
  - If the best path to a subnet goes down, routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available.
  - Using a combination of a dynamic routing protocol and static routes is very common in real-world environments.
  - In this case, the routing protocol will be used to carry the bulk of the network information.
  - Static routes can also be used on an as-needed basis. For example, for backup purposes or for a static route to the internet(which will typically be injected into the dynamic routing protocol and advertised to the rest of the routers). 

ROUTING PROTOCOLS TYPES
Routing protocols can be split into two main types:
    - Interior gateway protocols (IGPs)
    - Exterior gateway protocols (EGPs)
Interior gateway protocols are used for routing within an organisation
Exterior gateway protocols are used for routing between organisations over the Internet
The only EGP in use today is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Interior gateway protocols can be split into two main types:
    - Distance Vector routing protocols
    - Link State routing protocols

DISTANCE VECTOR ROUTING PROTOCOLS
    - In Distance Vector protocols, each router sends its directly connected neighbours a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks
    - Distance vector routing protocols do not advertise the entire network topology
    - A router only knows its directly connected neighbours and the lists of networks those neighbours have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbours
    - Distance Vector routing protocols are often called 'Routing by rumour'.

LINK STATE ROUTING PROTOCOLS
    - In Link State routing protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbours
    - This information is passed unchanged from one router to another
    - Every router learns the full picture of the network, including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to

## ROUTING PROTOCOLS

Routing protocols are categorised into **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)** and **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)**.

### Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)
Used **within a single Autonomous System (AS)**.

- **Distance Vector Protocols**
  - RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
  - EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) → often called "Advanced Distance Vector"

- **Link State Protocols**
  - OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
  - IS-IS (Intermediate System – Intermediate System)

### Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)
Used **between different Autonomous Systems (ASes)**.

- **Path Vector Protocols**
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

INTERIOR GATEWAY PROTOCOLS
    - All of the IGPs do the same job, which is to advertise routes within an organisation and determine the best path or paths
    - An organisation will typically pick one of the IGPs
    - If an organisation has multiple IGPs in effect (for example, because of a merger or an acquisition), information can be redistributed between them. This should generally be avoided.

METRIC
    - A router may receive multiple possible paths to get to a destination network
    - Only the best path will make it into the routing table and be used
    - The different IGPs use different methods to calculate the best path to a destination network
    - Each possible path will be assigned a 'metric' value by the routing protocol, which indicates how preferred the path is
    - The lowest metric value is preferred
    - Distance Vector routers advertise to each other the networks they know about, and their metric to get to each of them
    - Link State routers advertise all the links in their area of the network to each other
    - Each router will take this information and then make an independent calculation of its own best path to get to each destination
    - If the best path to a destination is lost (for example, because a link went down), it will be removed from the routing table and replaced with the next best route

RIP METRIC - HOP COUNT
    - RIP uses Hop Count as the metric
    - The maximum hop count by default is 15. Paths which are more than 15 hops away are marked as unreachable  
    - RIP is typically used only in small or test environments

OSPF METRIC - COST
    - OSPF uses 'Cost' as the metric, which is automatically derived from interface bandwidth by default
    - You can manually configure the cost of links if you want to manipulate the path

IS-IS METRIC - COST
    - IS-IS also uses 'COST' as the metric, but it is not automatically derived from interface bandwidth. All links have an equal cost by default
    - You can manually configure the cost of links if you want to manipulate the path  
    - If you do not manually set the link costs then the path with the lowest hop count will be used

EIGRP METRIC - COST
    - EIGRP uses the bandwidth and delay of links to calculate the metric
    - (Load and reliability can also be considered, but are ignored by default)
    - A fixed delay value is used based on the interface bandwidth; the protocol does not dynamically measure the current delay
    - You can manually configure the delay on links if you want to manipulate the path

Choosing a Routing Protocol
    - RIP uses hop count and has a default maximum metric of 15. It is not typically used in production networks due to its scalability limitations.
    - EIGRP is very simple to maintain, and calculates changes very quickly, and its metric calculation will normally choose the best path by default. It is typically supported only on Cisco routers
    - OSPF's metric calculation will typically choose the best path by default. It is an open standard which is supported by all vendors' routers and is the most commonly deployed IGP today. It is, however, more complicated to maintain than EIGRP.
    - IS-IS links need to be manually configured, or it will use the hop count to determine the best path. It is typically only used in Service Provider networks or large organisations with their own MPLS network, who choose it because of its scalability.

Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP)
    - If multiple paths to a destination have an equal metric, the router will enter all of the paths into the routing table
    - Equal Cost Multi-Path will load balance the outbound traffic to the destination over the different paths
    - All IGP routing protocols will perform ECMP by default
    - EIGRP is the only routing protocol which is capable of UnEqual Cost Multi Path. It must be manually configured to support this.

# Campus Design - Access, Distribution and Core Layers
  - The campus LAN should be designed for scalability, performance and security
  - To aid in a best practice design process, the network topology is split into access, distribution and core layers
  - The layers have their own design principles and characteristics

# THE ACCESS LAYER
  - End hosts such as desktop computers, servers, and IP phones connect to the network at the access layer
  - It is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost
  - Desktops typically have only one Network Interface Card (NIC), so they connect to one switch or Wireless Access Point
  - Servers will often have dual NICs and connect to a pair of redundant switches
  - Client access security measures are enabled at the Access Layer

# THE DISTRIBUTION LAYER
  - Access Layer switches uplink to Distribution Layer switches
  - The Distribution Layer switches serve as an aggregation point for the Access Layer and provide scalability
  - Distribution Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Access Layer switches connected to both
  - End hosts are not typically connected here
  - Most software policy, such as QoS, is enabled at this layer

# THE CORE LAYER
  - Distribution Layer switches uplink to Core Layer switches
  - Core Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Distribution Layer switches connected to both
  - Traffic between different parts of the campus network travels through the core, so it is designed for speed and resiliency
  - Software policy slows the switch down, so it should be avoided in the Core Layer

# Collapsed Distribution and Core
  - Smaller campuses do not need the scalability of three separate layers
  - In this case, a Collapsed Distribution and Core layer is used, where the Distribution and Core layer functions are performed on the same hardware device

WHY WE HAVE VLANS

# Router Operations
  - Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI stack
  - Hosts in separate IP subnets must send traffic via a router to communicate
  - Security rules on routers or firewalls can be used to easily control what traffic is allowed between different IP subnets at Layer 3
  - Routers do not forward broadcast traffic by default
  - They provide performance and security by splitting networks into smaller domains at Layer 3

# Switch Operations
  - Switches operate at Layer 2 of the OSI stack
  - They do forward broadcast traffic by default
  - By default, a campus switch network is one large broadcast domain
  - Switches flood broadcast traffic everywhere, including between different IP subnets
  - This raises performance and security concerns

# VLAN Virtual Local Area Networks
  - We can increase performance and security in the LAN by implementing VLANs on our switches
  - VLANs segment the LAN into separate broadcast domains at Layer 2
  - There is typically a one-to-one relationship between an IP subnet and a VLAN

# VLAN Access Ports
  - VLAN access ports are configured on switch interfaces where end hosts are plugged in
  - Access ports are configured with one specific VLAN
  - The configuration is all on the switch; the end host is not VLAN aware
  - Switches only allow traffic within the same VLAN

HOSTS IN THE SAME IP SEGMENT SHOULD BE IN THE SAME VLAN
HOSTS IN DIFFERENT IP SEGMENTS SHOULD BE IN THE SAME VLAN

# DEFAULT VLAN
  - All ports on a switch are by default in VLAN 1

# ACCESS PORT CONFIGURATION
  ENG vlan example
  - vlan 10
  - name ENG
  THEN YOU NEED TO ENTER THE INTERFACE VIEW OF THE INTERFACES YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS VLAN
  - interface FastEthernet 0/1
  - switchport mode access
  - switchport access vlan 1o
  YOU CAN ALSO ADD A RANGE OF INTERFACES AT THE SAME TIME USING A RANGE
  - interface range FastEthernet 0/3 - 5
  - switchport mode access
  - switchport access vlan 10

  You can then use the
  - show vlan brief command to verify your configuration

# Campus Design - Access, Distribution and Core Layers
  - The campus LAN should be designed for scalability, performance and security
  - To aid in a best practice design process, the network topology is split into access, distribution and core layers
  - The layers have their own design principles and characteristics

# THE ACCESS LAYER
  - End hosts such as desktop computers, servers, and IP phones connect to the network at the access layer
  - It is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost
  - Desktops typically have only one Network Interface Card (NIC), so they connect to one switch or Wireless Access Point
  - Servers will often have dual NICs and connect to a pair of redundant switches
  - Client access security measures are enabled at the Access Layer

# THE DISTRIBUTION LAYER
  - Access Layer switches uplink to Distribution Layer switches
  - The Distribution Layer switches serve as an aggregation point for the Access Layer and provide scalability
  - Distribution Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Access Layer switches connected to both
  - End hosts are not typically connected here
  - Most software policy, such as QoS, is enabled at this layer

# THE CORE LAYER
  - Distribution Layer switches uplink to Core Layer switches
  - Core Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Distribution Layer switches connected to both
  - Traffic between different parts of the campus network travels through the core, so it is designed for speed and resiliency
  - Software policy slows the switch down, so it should be avoided in the Core Layer

# Collapsed Distribution and Core
  - Smaller campuses do not need the scalability of three separate layers
  - In this case, a Collapsed Distribution and Core layer is used, where the Distribution and Core layer functions are performed on the same hardware device

# Cisco Device Memory
- Cisco routers and switches have 4 built-in memory locations:
  - ROM - Read Only Memory
  - Flash - newer devices use removable CompactFlash
  - NVRAM - Non-Volatile RAM
  - RAM - Random Access Memory

  An external USB device can also be used 

ROM - Read Only Memory
  - When the device is powered on, it will first load from ROM
  - Two main functions are performed:
    - Power on Self Test (POST)
    - Load Bootstrap
  - The bootstrap will look in Flash for an IOS software image to load

Flash Memory 
  - The system will load the first IOS image found in Flash by default
  - You can override this with the boot system command
  - You can copy additional IOS system images to Flash via TFTP or USB

NVRAM Non-Volatile RAM Memory
  - When the system has finished loading the IOS system image from Flash, it will load the startup-config configuration file from NVRAM
  - The saved startup=config becomes the current running-config in RAM  
  - If no startup-config file is found, the device will load the Setup Wizard
  - Whenever you enter a command in IOS, it takes effect immediately and goes into the running-config
  - To make your changes permanent across a reboot, enter:
      'copy running-config startup-config'

RAM Random Access Memory
  - The IOS system image and startup-config are loaded from Flash and NVRAM into RAM during bootup
  - RAM is used as the normal working memory of the device
  - ROM, Flash and NVRAM are permanent memory; their contents are not lost when the device is powered off or rebooted
  - RAM is volatile memory; its contents are lost when the device is powered off

The VLAN Database
  - On a switch, the VLAN database (vlan.dat) is saved in either Flash or NVRAM, depending on the model of the switch.

Factory Reset 
  - To factory reset a router or switch 
    'write erase'
  - This will erase the start-up config
  - Reload to boot up with a blank configuration
  - The setup wizard will run

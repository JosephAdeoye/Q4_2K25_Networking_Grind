### Router IP Addresses
  - A router provides connectivity between different IP subnets
  - An IP address must be configured on the interfaces in each subnet
---- Interfaces are shut down by default on a Router. Remember to enter the 'no shutdown' command.

### Switch Management IP Address  
  - A Layer 2 switch is IP routing aware.
  - It does, however, support a single IP address for management.
  - The IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1.
  - A default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets.
---- Interfaces are turned on by default on Switches.

### Interface Speed and Duplex
  - Interface speed and duplex is set to 'auto' by default
  - Both sides of a link should auto-negotiate to full duplex and the fastest available speed.
  - Best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex on ports which are connected to another network infrastructure device or server.
  - It is very important to set matching speed and duplex settings on both sides of the link.

### CDP Cisco Discovery Protocol
  - Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol.
  - It is used to share information with other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as the operating system version and IP address.
  - This aids in troubleshooting by allowing administrators to map out how Cisco devices are connected to each other.
  - It is enabled by default on most Cisco equipment.
  - It works at Layer 2, so the device doesn't need to have an IP address.

### CDP config commands
  - show cdp
  - show cdp neighbors
  - show cdp neighbors detail

### LLDP Link Layer Discovery Protocol
  - LLDP is an open standard protocol which provides similar information to CDP.
 ## Differences with CDP:
  - Depending on the switch and version, it may be disabled by default
  - It is only supported on physical interfaces
  - It can only discover up to one device per port
  - It can discover Linux servers

### LLDP config commands
  - show lldp
  - show lldp neighbors
  - show lldp neighbors detail

### Layer 1 Troubleshooting
  - Basic switch troubleshooting involves checking for Layer 1 and Layer 2 issues.
  - Copper and Fibre cables are liable to break if not handled correctly
Common Layer 1 problems include:
  - The interface is administratively shut down
  - The cable is disconnected on either or both ends
  - The device on the other end of the cable is powered off
  - Broken connectors, which cause loose connections
  - Bent or stretched cables, which lead to broken wires or fibres
  - Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) sources, such as motors or microwaves, which cause errors in transmission (newer cable is less susceptible to this)

###   Layer  1  Troubleshooting Commands  
  Switch# show ip interface brief
  - 'administratively down' - Issue 'no shutdown'
  - 'down/down' - This indicates a Layer 1 issue. Check that the interface is connected at both ends and that the device on the other side is powered on
  - 'up/down' - This indicates a Layer 2 issue or speed mismatch. Check the interface configuration matches on both sides of the link
  Switch# show interface
  - If the interface is reporting an excessive amount of errors, it could be either a layer 1 or layer 2 problem
  - Check the integrity  of the cable
  - Check the configuration matches on both sides of the link

### Speed and Duplex Mismatches
  - A possible error is speed and/or duplex mismatches
  - Incorrect speed settings can cause the interface to operate below its maximum speed
  - Speed mismatches will typically bring the interface down
  - The interface will typically stay up with duplex mismatches, but performance will be terrible because of collisions
  - The 'show interface' command will report an excessively high number of errors in this case
  - Both sides of a link must be set to the same, either auto or manually configured
  - Cisco devices default to auto
  - If one side is set to auto, and the other is manually configured, this will often result in a mismatch
  - Best practice is to manually configure ports attached to other network infrastructure devices or servers
  - Remember to manually configure both sides of the link
  - If a device has issues with auto-negotiating speed or duplex, manually configuring both sides will normally solve the problem

CDP SHOULD DETECT A DUPLEX MISMATCH

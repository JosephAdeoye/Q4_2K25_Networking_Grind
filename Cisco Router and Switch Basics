### Router IP Addresses
  - A router provides connectivity between different IP subnets
  - An IP address must be configured on the interfaces in each subnet
---- Interfaces are shut down by default on a Router. Remember to enter the 'no shutdown' command.

### Switch Management IP Address  
  - A Layer 2 switch is IP routing aware.
  - It does, however, support a single IP address for management.
  - The IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1.
  - A default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets.
---- Interfaces are turned on by default on Switches.

### Interface Speed and Duplex
  - Interface speed and duplex is set to 'auto' by default
  - Both sides of a link should auto-negotiate to full duplex and the fastest available speed.
  - Best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex on ports which are connected to another network infrastructure device or server.
  - It is very important to set matching speed and duplex settings on both sides of the link.

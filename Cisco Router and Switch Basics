### Router IP Addresses
  - A router provides connectivity between different IP subnets
  - An IP address must be configured on the interfaces in each subnet
---- Interfaces are shut down by default on a Router. Remember to enter the 'no shutdown' command.

### Switch Management IP Address  
  - A Layer 2 switch is IP routing aware.
  - It does, however, support a single IP address for management.
  - The IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1.
  - A default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets.
---- Interfaces are turned on by default on Switches.

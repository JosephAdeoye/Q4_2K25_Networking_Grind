### Router IP Addresses
  - A router provides connectivity between different IP subnets
  - An IP address must be configured on the interfaces in each subnet
---- Interfaces are shut down by default on a Router. Remember to enter the 'no shutdown' command.

### Switch Management IP Address  
  - A Layer 2 switch is IP routing aware.
  - It does, however, support a single IP address for management.
  - The IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1.
  - A default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets.
---- Interfaces are turned on by default on Switches.

### Interface Speed and Duplex
  - Interface speed and duplex is set to 'auto' by default
  - Both sides of a link should auto-negotiate to full duplex and the fastest available speed.
  - Best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex on ports which are connected to another network infrastructure device or server.
  - It is very important to set matching speed and duplex settings on both sides of the link.

### CDP Cisco Discovery Protocol
  - Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol.
  - It is used to share information with other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as the operating system version and IP address.
  - This aids in troubleshooting by allowing administrators to map out how Cisco devices are connected to each other.
  - It is enabled by default on most Cisco equipment.
  - It works at Layer 2, so the device doesn't need to have an IP address.

### CDP config commands
  - show cdp
  - show cdp neighbors
  - show cdp neighbors detail

### LLDP Link Layer Discovery Protocol
  - LLDP is an open standard protocol which provides similar information to CDP.
 ## Differences with CDP:
  - Depending on the switch and version, it may be disabled by default
  - It is only supported on physical interfaces
  - It can only discover up to one device per port
  - It can discover Linux servers

### LLDP config commands
  - show lldp
  - show lldp neighbors
  - show lldp neighbors detail

### Layer 1 Troubleshooting
  - Basic switch troubleshooting involves checking for Layer 1 and Layer 2 issues.
  - Copper and Fibre cables are liable to break if not handled correctly

## Cisco Troubleshooting Methodology

The Cisco troubleshooting process follows a structured flow:

1. **Define Problem**  
2. **Gather Information**  
3. **Analyze Information**  
4. **Eliminate Potential Causes**  
5. **Propose Hypothesis**  
6. **Test Hypothesis**  
7. **Solve Problem and Document Solution**

## Troubleshooting Methodologies

There are three main approaches to network troubleshooting based on the **OSI model**:

- **Top-Down**: Start from the Application layer and move downward toward the Physical layer.  
- **Bottom-Up**: Start from the Physical layer and move upward toward the Application layer.  
- **Divide and Conquer**: Begin testing at a middle layer (often Network or Transport) and then move up or down depending on results.

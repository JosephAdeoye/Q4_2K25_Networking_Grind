Cloud Computing
- According to NIST in 2011, Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convinient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resorces that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- On-Demand Self-Service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider
- Rapid Elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward according to demand.
- Broad Network Access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or think client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.)
- Resource Pooling: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned according to demand.
- Measured Service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).

Virtualization 
- is one of the main enables of cloud computing
- It allows for resource pooling where multiple customers share the underlying hardware

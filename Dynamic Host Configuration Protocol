### DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
  - DHCP is a client/server protocol that automatically provides a host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.
  - DHCP clients obtain their IP configuration information from a DHCP server, rather than being manually configured.

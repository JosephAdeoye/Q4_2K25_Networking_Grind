OSPF CHARACTERISTICS

  - OSPF is a Link State routing protocol
  - It supports large networks
  - It has a very fast convergence time
  - Messages are sent using multicast
  - OSPF is an open standard protocol
  - It uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First Algorithm to determine the best path to learned networks.

Link State Routing Protocols
  - In Link State routing protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbours
  - This information is passed unchanged from one router to another
  - Every router learns the full picture of the network, including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to
  - OSPF routers use LSA Link State Advertisements to pass on routing updates

OSPF Operations
  - Discover neighbours
  - Form adjacencies
  - Flood Link State Database (LSDB)
  - Compute Shortest Path
  - Install the best routes in the routing table
  - Respond to network changes

OSPF Packet Types
  - Hello Packets: A router will send out and listen for Hello packets when OSPF is enabled on an interface, and form adjacencies with other OSPF routers on the link
  - DD (Database Description) packets: Adjacent routers will tell each other what they know about the network with the DD Packet
  - LSR (Link State Request) packets: If a router is missing information about any of the networks in the received DD, it will send the neighbour an LSR packet
  - LSU (Link State Advertisement) packets: A routing update
  - LSU (Link State Update): Contains a list of LSAs which should be updated, used during flooding
  - LSAck (Link State Acknowledgement): Receiving routers acknowledge LSAs

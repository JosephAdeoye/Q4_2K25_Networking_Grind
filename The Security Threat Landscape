# The Security Threat Landscape
- Threat: has the potential to cause harm to an IT asset
- Vulnerability: a weakness that compromises the security or functionality
- Exploit: uses a weakness to compromise the security or functionality of a system
- Risk: the likelihood of a successful attack
- Mitigation: techniques to eliminate or reduce the potential of and seriousness of an attack

MALWARE is malicious software, including:
- Viruses:  software which inserts itself into other software and can spread from computer to computer. Requires human action to spread
- Worms: a self-propagating virus that can replicate itself
- Trojan horses: malicious software which looks legitimate to trick humans into triggering it. It often installs back doors
- Ransomware: encrypts data with the attacker's key and asks the victim to pay a ransom to obtain the key

COMMON ATTACKS

# Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

**Reconnaissance** is the first phase of a cyber attack, where an attacker gathers as much information as possible about a target before attempting exploitation.

---

## üîç What Happens During Reconnaissance
- The attacker collects **information about the intended victim**, such as domain names, IP addresses, or email patterns.  
- The process can start with **unobtrusive, open-source methods** (known as *passive reconnaissance*):
  - Searching public **WHOIS records**
  - Checking **job listings**, **phone directories**, or **company websites**
  - Reviewing social media and public documents  

- Once enough surface data is gathered, the attacker moves into **active reconnaissance**, using tools and scans to probe deeper:
  - **Ping sweeps** ‚Äì to identify live hosts  
  - **Port scans** ‚Äì to discover open or vulnerable services  
  - **Vulnerability scanners** ‚Äì to identify exploitable weaknesses

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Reconnaissance

| Type | Description | Example Tools |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Passive** | Gathers info without directly interacting with the target | WHOIS lookup, Google Dorking |
| **Active** | Directly interacts with target systems to collect data | Nmap, Netcat, Nessus |

---

##  Key Insight
Reconnaissance is essentially the **planning phase of a cyber attack**.  
The more information an attacker collects, the easier it becomes to find weaknesses and plan successful intrusions.

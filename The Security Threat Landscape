# The Security Threat Landscape
- Threat: has the potential to cause harm to an IT asset
- Vulnerability: a weakness that compromises the security or functionality
- Exploit: uses a weakness to compromise the security or functionality of a system
- Risk: the likelihood of a successful attack
- Mitigation: techniques to eliminate or reduce the potential of and seriousness of an attack

MALWARE is malicious software, including:
- Viruses:  software which inserts itself into other software and can spread from computer to computer. Requires human action to spread
- Worms: a self-propagating virus that can replicate itself
- Trojan horses: malicious software which looks legitimate to trick humans into triggering it. It often installs back doors
- Ransomware: encrypts data with the attacker's key and asks the victim to pay a ransom to obtain the key

COMMON ATTACKS

# Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

**Reconnaissance** is the first phase of a cyber attack, where an attacker gathers as much information as possible about a target before attempting exploitation.

---

## 🔍 What Happens During Reconnaissance
- The attacker collects **information about the intended victim**, such as domain names, IP addresses, or email patterns.  
- The process can start with **unobtrusive, open-source methods** (known as *passive reconnaissance*):
  - Searching public **WHOIS records**
  - Checking **job listings**, **phone directories**, or **company websites**
  - Reviewing social media and public documents  

- Once enough surface data is gathered, the attacker moves into **active reconnaissance**, using tools and scans to probe deeper:
  - **Ping sweeps** – to identify live hosts  
  - **Port scans** – to discover open or vulnerable services  
  - **Vulnerability scanners** – to identify exploitable weaknesses

## ⚙️ Types of Reconnaissance

| Type | Description | Example Tools |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Passive** | Gathers info without directly interacting with the target | WHOIS lookup, Google Dorking |
| **Active** | Directly interacts with target systems to collect data | Nmap, Netcat, Nessus |

##  Key Insight
Reconnaissance is essentially the **planning phase of a cyber attack**.  
The more information an attacker collects, the easier it becomes to find weaknesses and plan successful intrusions.

Social Engineering
- Social Engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information.
- It typically involves nothing more technical than the use of a telephone or email.
- The attacker will often pretend to be somebody else to trick the victim

Phising
- Phishing is a Social Engineering attack where the attacker pretends to be from a reputable company to get individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.
- The victim is often directed to enter their details into the attacker's website which looks like the reputable company's legitimate website.

Data Exfiltration
- Data exfiltration is where data leaves an organisation without authorisation.
- This can be by a hacker who has comprimised a system
- Or by an internal staff member, either maliciously or by accident 

DoS Denial of Service 
- A Denial of Service (DoS) attack prevents legitimate users from accessing an IT resource.
- It is typically a brute force style of attack which floods the target system with more traffic than it can handle.
- DoS attacks from a single source can easily be stopped by blocking traffic from that host

DDoS Distributed Denial of Service 
- A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a DoS attack from multiple sources.
- The attacker builds and controls a botnet army of infected zombie hosts.
- The botnet is built through malware such as worms and trojan horses.
- Infected hosts connect out to the attacker's commaand and control server. This circumvents firewalls because the connecion is initiated from the inside
- The attacker now has control of the botnet to launch attacks
- DDoD attacks are more difficult to mitigate against because the attack comes from multiple sources which could normally be expected to send legitimate traffic

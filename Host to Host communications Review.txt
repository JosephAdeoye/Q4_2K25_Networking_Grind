Day 1
## OSI Model
I am reviewing the Open Systems Interconnection Model first. The OSI Model is a 7 layer framework that standardizes how computers communicate with each other over a network.
A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it 
The layers are;
1. Application layer L7
2. Presentation layer L6
3. Session layer L5
4. Transport layer (TCP/UDP, Port(HTTP-80, SMTP-25, etc)) L4
5. Network layer (Source and Destination IP addresses) L3 - ROUTERS
6. Data Link layer (Source and Destination MAC Addresses) L2 - SWITCHES
7. Physical layer

## TCP/IP SUITE
The TCP/IP suite was developed in the 1960 by the US DoD, Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
It is a protocol stack that consist of multiple protocols including TCP and IP
It is the main protocol stack used in computer operations today 
TCP/IP is also layered but it does not use all the layers in the OSI model
TCP/IP layers
1. Application layer (encapsulates the Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI Model)
2. Transport layer (is also the transport layer in the OSI Model)
3. Intenet layer (is the network layer of the OSI Model)
4. Link layer (encapsulates the Data Link and Physical layers)

Acronym for TCP/IP - Lieing Is Pretty Awful

## Host to Host communication terminologies 
When two hosts communicate with each other, they exchange Protocol Data Units(PDUs)
# PDUs name per layer
1. Application layer - Data
2. Transport layer - Segment
3. Intenet layer - Packet
4. Link layer - Frame

## L7 - Application layer
This layer provides network services to the applications of the user
The layer establishes the availability of intended communication partners.
It then synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control data integrity.

## L6 - Presentation layer
This layer ensures that the information that is sent at the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of another system.
This layer can translate among multiple data formats using a common format (e.g computers with different encoding schemes)

## L5 - Session layer
This layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between communicating hosts
This layer also synchronizes dialog between the Presentation layers of the two hosts and manages their data exchange
For example, web servers have many users, so there are many communication processes open at any given time to track
It also efficient data transfer, CoS and exception reporting of upper layer problems

## L4 - Transport layer
The main characteristics of the Transport layer are whether TCP or UDP transport is used, and the port number
The transport layer defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices
It breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to incur transmission problems

## L3 - Network layer
The most important information at the network layer is the Source and Destination IP addresses
Routers and L3 switches operate at the Layer 3
The network layer provides connectivity and path selection between two hosts that may be located on geographically separated networks.
This layer manages the connectivity of hosts by providing logical addressing (IP Addresses)

## L2 Data layer
The most important information at this layer is the Source and Destination MAC addresses
Switches operate at L2
This layer defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the Physical media is controlled
It also typically includes error detection and correction to ensure a reliable delivery of the data

## L1 Physical layer
This layer concerns itself with the Physical components of the network, for example the cables being used.
The Physical link enables bit transmission between end devices
It defines specifications needed for activating and maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between end devices. E.g voltage levels, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, etc.
